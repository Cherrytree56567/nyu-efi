limine-efi
==========

limine-efi is a fork of GNU-EFI that strips out all code save for
the relocation stubs and the core EFI header files.

Additionally, it ships, in the "inc" directory, the ELF headers necessary
for the relocation code to build, along with a rework of said relocation
code and linker scripts.

For an example on how to use this, see:
